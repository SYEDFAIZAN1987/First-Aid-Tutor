    "For infants 3-6 months with a rectal temperature up to 102째F (38.9째C), encourage rest and plenty of fluids; medication is not needed but refer to the doctor if the child seems unusually irritable, lethargic, or uncomfortable.",

    "Provide sugar-containing liquids like fruit juice or 5-6 hard candies. If unconscious, place glucose powder under their tongue and refer them immediately to a hospital.",

    "RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. It is used to treat sprains, strains, fractures, and joint dislocations.",

    "Lay the patient down and keep them calm. Apply a tourniquet above the bite site, loosening it every 10 minutes. "
    "Wash the wound gently with saline or antiseptic lotion and apply a clean dressing. "
    "Immobilize the affected limb and apply ice packs. Transport the patient to a hospital immediately.",

    "Symptoms of shock include pale, clammy skin, rapid pulse, dizziness, and weakness. "
    "First aid measures involve laying the patient down, elevating their legs, covering them with a blanket, stopping any bleeding, "
    "and giving sugar water if they are conscious. Immediate hospital transfer is required.",

    "Ensure the person is in a safe area. Do not restrain their movements or put anything in their mouth. "
    "Loosen tight clothing and turn them on their side after the seizure ends. "
    "Call for medical assistance if the seizure lasts longer than five minutes or repeats.",

    "For a choking adult, stand behind them and perform the Heimlich maneuver: wrap arms around their waist, "
    "place a fist slightly above the navel, and thrust upwards. For infants, hold them upside down and slap their back.",

    "Run the burned area under cold water or apply an ice pack until the pain subsides. "
    "Clean and bandage the burn to prevent infection. For chemical burns, rinse the affected area for 15-20 minutes with water.",

    "If a person faints, lay them flat for at least 15 minutes. Raise their legs above the heart level. "
    "Loosen any restrictive clothing and check their breathing. If they remain unconscious, call emergency services.",

    "For a known dog, wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water, apply antiseptic, and give a tetanus toxoid injection. "
    "If the dog is unknown, refer the patient to a doctor immediately for an anti-rabies vaccine.",
